# Analyzing New York City High School SAT Scores
## Executive Summary

This analysis explores the correlation between the average SAT score for New York City High Schools for the 2012 graduating class with a number of factors about the schools and the students in them. These factors include race, school total enrollment, average class size, gender, AP Test information, and safety ratings gathered from a survey. Investigating these factors outlined the structural disparate outcomes between schools in the New York City school system, much of which is by design through the specialized and magnet school framework the city uses. Beyond these structural differences, both race and school/class size stood out as strongly correlated with SAT scores. The percent of White or Asian students in a given school was positively correlated with SAT outcomes, while the percent of Black or Hispanic students was negatively correlated. Both a school's total enrollment and average class size were positively correlated with SAT scores, meaning that larger schools tended to perform better on the test. Moving forward, we recommend further researching the SAT's equivalence with academic success we assumed in this analysis, investigating the correlation between class size and average school SAT score further as we interpret this trend as potentially actionable for all schools across New York City, and searching for more granular school safety data to better understand how school safety may affect academic outcomes.
