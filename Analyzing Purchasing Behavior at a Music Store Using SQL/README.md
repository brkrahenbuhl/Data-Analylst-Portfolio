# Analyzing Purchasing Behavior at a Music Store Using SQL
## Executive Summary
In this project we want to explore the behavior of customers at our music store in order to optimize our future ordering strategy. In this case optimization is defined as ordering music that is most likely to sell at our store. We analyzed a few specific topics that could influence future ordering behavior including genres, customer countries of residence, and album purchasing behavior.

Rock is the most popular genre of the store and we recommend increasing the proportion of rock songs offered in the store's catalog. Additionally, 68 percent of tracks sold are sold as individual tracks as opposed to as part of an album so we recommend increasing the breadth of popular singles available in the store.

Further analysis to better optimize sales strategy includes tracking purchasing behavior over a longer time range, gathering additional patient demographics, and conducting more targeted experimentation of potential strategies.
