    "# Analyzing Purchasing Behavior at a Music Store Using SQL\n",
    "\n",
    "## Executive Summary\n",
    "In this project we want to explore the behavior of customers at our music store in order to optimize our future ordering strategy. In this case optimization is defined as ordering music that is most likely to sell at our store. We analyzed a few specific topics that could influence future ordering behavior including genres, customer countries of residence, and album purchasing behavior.\n",
    "\n",
    "Rock is the most popular genre of the store and we recommend increasing the proportion of rock songs offered in the store's catalog. Additionally, 68 percent of tracks sold are sold as individual tracks as opposed to as part of an album so we recommend increasing the breadth of popular singles available in the store.\n",
    "\n",
    "Further analysis to better optimize sales strategy includes tracking purchasing behavior over a longer time range, gathering additional patient demographics, and conducting more targeted experimentation of potential strategies."

    "## Background and Goals\n",
    "\n",
    "In this project, we are consulting for a small digital music store whose leadership team wishes to maximize their sales revenue from the limited collection of albums and singles they sell. The store intends to use the results of our analysis to determine future direction for which music they will continue to stock. They have been tracking their sales for the past two weeks, along with a handful of extra data elements that they have a hunch are influencing their amount of sales, and they want us to help them establish patterns in what is seling successfully and what isn't. They called our attention to a few factors specifically, although they are open to any other insights we may find:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Genre of music purchased\n",
    "2. Sales agent engaged with the customer\n",
    "3. Nationality of customer base\n",
    "\n",
    "Upon having initial discussions with the store owner, we agreed that the goal of this initial analysis is to maximize the amount of sales revenue per song offered in the store's catalog."

Since this is an online retailer, many transactions aren't attributed to a certain sales rep, so first we'll investigate if the volume of sales involving a support rep is high enough that further analysis is warranted.

    "## Conclusion\n",
    "\n",
    "In this analysis we reviewed four topics within a dataset of purchases from an online music store: genres, support representatives, the country a customer purchased from, and whether customers are purchasing albums or singles. From our initial analysis we made the following conclusions.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Rock is the genre with the most tracks sold the genre that a given customer is most likely to have purchased a track from. This trend holds across the countries that the music store has sales in.\n",
    "* The amount of sales for each support representative working at the store is similar enough that this isn't a major factor in optimizing future sales.\n",
    "* The United States and Canada are the two most prevalent markets for the store, with remaining purchases spread out throughout the world.\n",
    "* Customers are purchasing more individual tracks than full albums with over 68 percent of tracks sold not associated with an album purchase.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Initial Recommendations\n",
    "\n",
    "Our top recommendation is to continue investing in rock as a genre. Even though rock is already the most prevelant genre in the catalog, it makes up a higher percentage of sales than it does inventory. Additionally, every customer that has purchased from the site in the two weeks we analyzed purchased at least one rock song. For these reasons, we should continue to invest in this area and continue establishing our place in the market.\n",
    "\n",
    "We also recommend revisiting contracts with the music labels the store works with in order to move more towards an individual track based model. If the website is able to offer a more broad selection of popular songs within it's highest selling genres we'd expect to see more sales per song offered.\n",
    "\n",
    "In terms of further investment and marketing in certain demographics, we recommend continuing to gather data on customer demographics as we feel more targeted marketing would be more effective for small store such as this. The United States market is the largest in terms of sales, so if we have a constraint on gathering data we can focus our data gathering efforts on US customers.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Further Analysis\n",
    "\n",
    "First and foremost, this dataset only contained two weeks of purchases; we wish to continue tracking this data moving forward to gather a larger dataset we can perform the same analysis on. It is possible that conclusions and recommendations can change with a larger dataset. \n",
    "\n",
    "As discussed in the Initial Recommendations section, while gathering customer data can be sensitive because of privacy concerns, we feel that more analysis is warranted to better target future marketing efforts. We already have more detailed customer location data that is the next step for analyzing this topic, but we currently are lacking customer demographic data which can be used more effectively in online marketing. \n",
    "\n",
    "Last, as we start implementing the recommendations from this analysis we can start more discretely testing the effectiveness of certain hypotheses, such as whether moving to a model based on offering a larger breadth of individual tracks as opposed to albums will result in higher sales.\n",
