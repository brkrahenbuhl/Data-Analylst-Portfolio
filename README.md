# Ben Krahenbuhl - Data Analyst Portfolio
## About

Hello! My name is Ben Krahenbuhl and I've created this GitHub repository to house the projects I'm working on that showcase my skill in extracting and manipulating data with the goal of both finding actionable recommendations and enabling others to do the same.

I have extensive experience working with data in a database administration context, including SQL, ETL processes, and database admin tasks including storage configuration, maintenance jobs, and query performance troubleshooting. While I've enjoyed learning this skill set, my true passion lies with more directly utilizing data to drive meaningful insights and actionable recommendations, leading me to pursue education in data analysis. I've worked with all levels of partner organizations, from IT analysts to C-suite decision makers, as a vendor support contact has cemented my dedication towards supporting stakeholders and maximizing the value they bring to their organizations.

**Tableau Link**: [Tableau Public Workbook](https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/ben.krahenbuhl/viz/ArizonaPublicHealthMeasureExplorationWorkbook/Dashboard1)<br>
**Description**: This project visualizes publicly available data from the 2020 through 2022 released of the [PLACES program](https://www.cdc.gov/places/index.html), a US program to calculate data on a set of public health measures across the United States and release the results to the public.<br>
**Technologies Used**: Tableau, T-SQL

### Analyzing New York City High School SAT Scores
**Directory**: [Analyzing New York City High School SAT Scores](https://github.com/brkrahenbuhl/Data-Analyst-Portfolio/tree/main/Analyzing%20NYC%20High%20School%20Data)<br>
**Code**: [Cleaning and Analyzing NYC High School Data.ipynb](https://github.com/brkrahenbuhl/Data-Analyst-Portfolio/blob/b72091435ec2d665c9bf8f45263aec85cd45e024/Analyzing%20NYC%20High%20School%20Data/Cleaning%20and%20Analyzing%20NYC%20High%20School%20Data.ipynb)]<br>
**Description**: This project starts with SAT score data for New York City public schools and combines it with a number of data sets containing demographic breakdowns and survey results of those same schools. After cleaning and combining the data, we investigate correlations between average SAT score for a given school and potentially related factors to understand both inherent differences between schools and what high-performing schools may be doing differently than can be applied to the system as a whole.<br>
**Technologies Used**: Python - Pandas, Matplotlib modules

### Analyzing Purchasing Behavior at a Music Store Using SQL
**Directory**: [Analyzing Purchasing Behavior at a Music Store Using SQL](https://github.com/brkrahenbuhl/Data-Analyst-Portfolio/tree/main/Analyzing%20Purchasing%20Behavior%20at%20a%20Music%20Store%20Using%20SQL#analyzing-purchasing-behavior-at-a-music-store-using-sql)<br>
**Code**: [Analyzing Purchasing Behavior at a Music Store Using SQL.ipynb](https://github.com/brkrahenbuhl/Data-Analyst-Portfolio/blob/b72091435ec2d665c9bf8f45263aec85cd45e024/Analyzing%20Purchasing%20Behavior%20at%20a%20Music%20Store%20Using%20SQL/Analyzing%20Purchasing%20Behavior%20at%20a%20Music%20Store%20Using%20SQL.ipynb)<br>
**Description**: In this project we are analyzing sales data for a fictional music store with the goal to help them maximize their sales through changing the music the store orders for its catalog. We investigate customer demographics, the best-selling genres at the store, and purchasing behavior between albums and individual tracks and provide recommendations on better tailoring the store's catalog to what is selling best with their established customers. <br>
**Technologies Used**: SQL
