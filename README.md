# Ben Krahenbuhl - Data Analylst Portfolio
## About

Hello! My name is Ben Krahenbuhl and I've created this GitHub repository to house the projects I'm working on that showcase my skill in extracting and manipulating data with the goal of both finding actionable recommendations and enabling others to do the same.

I have extensive experience working with data in a database administration context, including SQL, ETL processes, and database admin tasks including storage configuration, maintenance jobs, and query performance troubleshooting. While I've enjoyed learning this skillset, my true passion lies with more directly utilizing data to drive meaningful insights and actionable recommendations, leading me to pursue education in data analysis. I've worked with all levels of partner organizations, from IT analysts to C-suite decision makers, as a vendor support contact has cemented my dedication towards suppporting stakeholders and maximizing the value they bring to their organizations.
